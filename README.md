### Summary of 500 Problems
- **Total Problems**: 500
- **Breakdown by Topic**:
  - Arrays & Hashing: 80 problems (30 detailed + 50 concise)
  - Strings: 65 problems (25 detailed + 40 concise)
  - Linked Lists: 65 problems (25 detailed + 40 concise)
  - Stacks & Queues: 50 problems (20 detailed + 30 concise)
  - Trees & Binary Search Trees: 80 problems (30 detailed + 50 concise)
  - Graphs: 65 problems (25 detailed + 40 concise)
  - Sorting & Searching: 66 problems (30 detailed + 36 concise)
  - Dynamic Programming: 25 problems (all detailed)
- **Breakdown by Difficulty**:
  - Easy: ~200 problems (focus on fundamentals, e.g., Two Sum, Valid Palindrome)
  - Medium: ~200 problems (core patterns like sliding window, BFS/DFS, e.g., 3Sum, Course Schedule)
  - Hard: ~100 problems (advanced optimization, edge cases, e.g., Median of Two Sorted Arrays, Burst Balloons)

### Practice Strategy
1. **Beginner Phase (Easy, ~200 problems)**:
   - Start with Easy problems in each topic (e.g., Two Sum, Valid Parentheses, Maximum Depth of Binary Tree).
   - Focus on understanding basic data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees) and algorithms (hashing, two pointers, DFS/BFS).
   - Solve 20-30 problems per topic, aiming for 30-45 minutes per problem.
   - Review solutions on LeetCode Discuss or NeetCode.io for clarity.

2. **Intermediate Phase (Medium, ~200 problems)**:
   - Tackle Medium problems to master patterns like sliding window (e.g., Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters), topological sort (e.g., Course Schedule), and DP (e.g., Coin Change).
   - Solve 100-150 Medium problems, spending 45-60 minutes per problem.
   - Practice under timed conditions to simulate interviews.
   - Revisit failed problems after a week to reinforce learning.

3. **Pro Phase (Hard, ~100 problems)**:
   - Focus on Hard problems for optimization and edge cases (e.g., Trapping Rain Water, Merge k Sorted Lists).
   - Combine techniques (e.g., DP + binary search in Burst Balloons).
   - Solve 50-100 Hard problems, allowing 60-90 minutes per problem.
   - Study official solutions and optimize for time/space complexity.

4. **Resources**:
   - **Curated Lists**: Use [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) for high-impact problems, [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) for a structured roadmap, or [Grind 75](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) for customizable practice.
   - **LeetCode Explore**: Follow topic-wise cards (e.g., Arrays, Graphs, Dynamic Programming) on [LeetCode Explore](https://leetcode.com/explore/).
   - **Community**: Check LeetCode Discuss or X posts for problem insights and company-specific trends.
   - **GitHub Sheets**: Use [DSA-LeetCode-Sheet](https://github.com/maheshshinde9100/DSA-LeetCode-Sheet) for additional problems beyond this list.

5. **Extending to 500+**:
   - Explore LeetCode’s full problem set (~3000 problems as of 2025) by filtering by topic, difficulty, or company tags (e.g., Amazon, Google).
   - Use LeetCode’s “Similar Questions” feature to find variations of solved problems.
   - Supplement with problems from platforms like HackerRank, Codeforces, or AlgoExpert for diverse perspectives.

### Notes
- **Duplicates**: Some problems appear in multiple topics (e.g., Longest Valid Parentheses in Strings and Stacks) to emphasize different solution approaches (e.g., stack vs. DP). This is intentional to reinforce versatility.
- **Customization**: If you want a focus on specific topics (e.g., only Graphs or DP), company-specific problems (e.g., FAANG), or detailed solutions for any of the 500 problems, let me know.
- **Tracking Progress**: Use LeetCode’s problem tracking or a spreadsheet to monitor solved problems, difficulty, and patterns mastered.

This list of 500 problems provides a comprehensive path from beginner to pro, covering all essential DSA concepts for technical interviews.
